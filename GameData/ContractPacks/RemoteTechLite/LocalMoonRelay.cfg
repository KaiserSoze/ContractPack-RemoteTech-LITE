    title = RemoteTech: Create a network for @/moonTarget.
    description = @/description2
    synopsis = Build a communication network that provides coverage of @/moonTarget with a link back to mission control.
    completedMessage = The network is up and transmitting, and our shake-out testing is complete!
	
	notes = You will need at least 3 satellites to do this mission. A three satellite network must have a minimum periapsis of @/satsMinPeri3Km.Print()  Km, whereas a four satellite network must have a minimum periapsis of @/satsMinPeri4Km.Print() Km.  Note that these are the bare minimum numbers to have visibility, it is recommended to use higher orbits to give a larger margin of error.
